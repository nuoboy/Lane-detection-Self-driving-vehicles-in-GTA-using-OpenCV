# Gameplay Automation with computer vision and Deep Learning

Here I tried to implement a lane detection based autonomous driving algorithm and a deep learning based driving algorithm. It was tested on GTA 5. 

Traditional OpenCV methods were used to find out the lanes and refer code to understand how driving decisions are made.

For the deep learning approach a custom dataset was generated by playing the game manually. Then the images and control inputs as labels were used to train a CNN to output control decisions for an unseen image.
